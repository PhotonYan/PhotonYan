## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shaoheng Yan (PhotonYan).

Iâ€™m now an undergraduate student of Peking University. I am currently majoring in Artificial Intelligence while pursuing a double degree in Physics, with a focus on exploring the intersection of these fields through interdisciplinary knowledge and research.
